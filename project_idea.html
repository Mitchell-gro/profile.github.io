        <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The project shall be based on a video game; this game shall be called “Horizon Hunters”.  Horizon Hunter is a video game that is inspired off of the popular video game "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DayZ_(video_game)" target="_blank">DayZ</a>", DayZ is solely a massively multiplayer online survival game, based in Russia, where the player has to find resources to survive, along with defending themselves from zombies and possibly other survivalists.
</p>

<div class="item cont-2">
    <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p>
The required tools and technologies that are required for the project are as follows in the elements below:
<br></br>
<b>Software:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Windows 11 operating system:  Windows 11 OS is a widely used and supported OS, personally, it feels easier to use and find required software and hardware that is compatible with Windows 11. I have years of experience with Windows, so I’d prefer to use it as the main OS</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5" target="_blank">Unreal Engine 5: </a>: Unreal Engine 5 is a well developed and founded game engine by Epic Games. It is written in C++ and C programming language, and it is free. Unreal Engine 5 shows to have strong potential in the gaming industry, especially as demonstrated in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WU0gvPcc3jQ" target="_blank">“Unreal Engine 5 – The Matrix Awakens Demo” </a>, which was made in co-operation with the popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_Awakens" target="_blank">“Matrix”</a> franchise</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<b>Hardware:</b>
<ul>
  <li>High-Spec PC: A PC with high specifications such as a powerful CPU, GPU, and sufficient RAM, will be required to develop the game correctly, along with reducing time delays, bottlenecks, errors, etc.</li>
  <li>Storage/Backups: It is of upmost importance to have the game and other related software assets securely backed up, an online storage solution (such as Google Drive) would be preferred as it’s easier and possibly cheaper.</li>
</p>
</div>

<div class="item cont-3">
    <h2>Skills required</h2>
<p>
  I will need to have some skills in C++ programming language or other related game development language, as it will be required for Unreal Engine 5 and the overall development of the game.
<br></br>
  There is some feasibility towards finding skills required for Unreal Engine 5, as Unreal Engine is a very popular game engine used by major game developers (such as Epic Games), bound to have lots of resources, educational sources, and support for it. Also, I have a basic knowledge in Java programming, which can be related towards C++.
</p>
</div>

<div class="item cont-4">
    <h2>Outcome</h2>

<p>
  In the event of successful project completion, the imagined outcome shall be that the game is in a stable beta testing stage. Along with having all planned out minimal requirements fulfilled such as ensuring the game is stable with solid framerate, weapons functioning as intended, etc.
  <br></br>
  The game should also hopefully attract attention from large game companies (Epic Games, EA, Microsoft Games, CD Projekt Red, etc), meaning possible extra funding and support towards the desired full development and completion of the game.

</p>
</div>

<div class="item cont-5">
    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Horizon Hunter will be focused upon serval important game elements, these game elements include story (and its unique rewards with it), customisation, weapons, realism (including the survival aspects), location/map (along with the elements of it), and multiplayer (ensuring long-term player base activity). The elements will be further detailed in the following sections.
</p>
</div>

<div class="item cont-6">
  <h2>Story</h2>

<p>The story starts off with the player customising their character (detailed further under the customisation element), the start and/or progression of the story will vary depending on what background the player chooses, along with the choices that the player makes throughout their gameplay.
  <br> </br>
  For example, if a player chooses the ‘nomad’ background, and they encounter a suspicious looking house, occupied by a survivor, the nomad thanks to their background and knowledge of natural environments and basic survival skills (such as hunting, farming, etc.) will be able to detect that it is a trap, and avoid falling for it. Whereas other backgrounds will not pick this up.</p>
</div>

<div class="item cont-7">
  <h2>Customisation (to be developed, when feasible)</h2>

<p>There will be a detailed character customisation (which will be developed hopefully in the future, as it isn’t currently feasible), including height, race, age, cosmetics (limited amount at the start, as the player will earn more as they progress throughout the story), background (the player can choose to come from different backgrounds, such as a prepper, nomad, hunter, army, convict, and more, which will be developed in the future, as it’s currently not feasible), along with many other character details such as eyes, ears, nose, etc.
  <br> </br>
Also, there will be a detailed weapon customisation, inspired by the popular first person shooter franchise "<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/au/en/" target="_blank">Call of Duty</a>", the player will be allowed to install attachments/modifications to their weapon, depending on what level you are along with what attachments/modification you have on you. Each modification/attachment will make an impact on the weapon’s performance, allowing the player to modify any weapon to their preferred playstyle.</p>
</div>

<div class="item cont-8">
  <h2>Realism</h2>

<p>The weapon mechanics of the game shall be intended to be as realistic as possible, so for example, the player feels the true and real recoil and knockback from an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M60_machine_gun" target="_blank">M60 Light Machine Gun</a> along with the muzzle brake attachment equipped.
  <br> </br>
Also, there will be a detailed weapon customisation, inspired by the popular first person shooter franchise ""<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/au/en/" target="_blank">Call of Duty</a>", the player will be allowed to install attachments/modifications to their weapon, depending on what level you are along with what attachments/modification you have on you. Each modification/attachment will make an impact on the weapon’s performance, allowing the player to modify any weapon to their preferred playstyle.</p>

<div class="item cont-9">
  <h2>Map/Location</h2>

<p>Our desired location is to have a fictional tropical and icy environment, inspired of off South America, or at least somewhat similar. As it allows for diverse elements such as snowy regions, and tropical regions.</p>
</div>

<div class="item cont-10">
  <h2>Multiplayer (to be developed, when feasible)</h2>

  <p>Multiplayer shall be heavily inspired by the prior mentioned game DayZ, making it a Massively Multiplayer Online and First & Third Person Shooter. Players can choose to work together and create factions or choose to hunt each other.
    <br> </br>
  There will be survival aspects of the game such finding territory to claim and survive from, along with searching for weapons, medical supplies, food, and possibly, other players.</p>
