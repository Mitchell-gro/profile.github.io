<h2>Personal Infomation:</h2>
<p>My name is Mitchell Groenewaldt, I was born in Australia at the Austin Hospital, my background is half Italian on my mother’s side, half South African on my dad’s side. My mum was born in Australia, whilst my dad was born in Cape Town South Africa.
In terms of culture, I usually follow up on the traditional Italian culture of spending lots of time with family such as my grandparents and cousins, we often catch up for a meal, commonly having something Italian, or even something light like a coffee or tea.
Education that I have completed consist of Year 12 VCE, and Diploma of Information Technology at RMIT.
One interesting fact about myself is I am a massive car enthusiast, I have been a major car fanatic ever since the age of 3, according to my parents, I could name any cars even rare cars like the Jaguar XJ220 (shown in the image below) without seeing the badge.

<h2>Intrest in IT:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</b><section>
</section> My interest in IT started at the age of 4. My interest in IT mainly consists of working on computers such building PCs for not only myself but friends as well as meeting their requirements, performing maintenance such as repairs and troubleshooting, setting up routers which I had done in my Diploma of IT I enjoyed the physical aspect of hooking up routers and switches to each other, and if possible, to work on ECUs (Engine Control Unit) on cars, mainly perform ECU tuning, as ECU tuning is a very big element in the automotive industry, lots of high-end racing manufacturers such as Nissan Motorsports International (NISMO), Mugen Motorsports, Scuderia Ferrari, and many other companies (even locally) have a large demand in ECU tuners, as not many people have taken upon this role, so it combines my two favourite things, cars and IT.</li>

<br></br>
<li><b>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any). </b><section>
</section> A particular event that sparked my interest was that my dad had two desktop PCs running Windows XP, I used to download and play games on them, along with also having a PlayStation 2 as a child, which developed my curiosity and fascination on IT along with sparking my interest in IT, over time my passion towards IT related things have increased, I begun to study up more on specifically PCs, IT in cars, along with software related IT elements such as emulation and virtualisation as an example.
I was self-taught with emulation, mainly I went in with no knowledge and experimented to figure out how it works, along with what does and doesn’t work. I did watch some YouTube videos and read up on forums to further my knowledge on emulation as well. I currently use many emulators such as PPSSPP (<a href="https://www.ppsspp.org/" target="_blank">https://www.ppsspp.org/</a>) which a PlayStation Portable emulator, PCSX2 (<a href="https://pcsx2.net/" target="_blank">https://pcsx2.net/</a>) A PlayStation 2 emulator, along with many other emulators.</li>

<br></br>
<li><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b><section>
</section> I choose to come to RMIT because RMIT offers the best IT educational services and resources for students to work with, in comparison to many other universities that I have scouted out. Also, I choose to come to RMIT due to having a previous enrolment at RMIT, I was previously enrolled in the Diploma of Information Technology which I had recently completed. RMIT had offered me that course in the past and I really enjoyed it, so I decided to pursue further studies at RMIT</li>

<br></br>
<li><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b><section>
</section> I expect to learn important IT related skills such as programming languages (such as Java, Python, C++, etc), problem solving (resolving any issues no matter it being hardware or software), along with developing my knowledge and understanding of IT. I am hoping for the new skills and improvement of my IT knowledge will help me towards achieving a good job in the IT industry, especially any that involve some practical/physical work.</li>

</ul>
<br></br>

<h2>Personal Profile:</h2>
<div><img src="images/Personality.png" alt="Personality test results"></div>
<ul>
  <li><b>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </b><section>
</section> <i>Personality test:</i> The results state that I am a Consul personality, meaning that I am a very supportive, social, and well-mannered person. This means to me that I have the skills and personality to work well with others, even in a team, I can either work as a team leader, or team supporter (helping the team achieve goals or resolve any issues). Also, I have discovered that this also means I am very supportive and can help others when they are in need.</li>

<br></br>
<li><i>Online learning style test:</i> From the test, I have discovered that I am both a Visual and Tactile learner, I found this rather unsurprising, as I’ve always found when it came towards learning and working, I’d always prefer to be shown how to do things, along with also having a physical attempt or practical work with the topic at hand. I struggle to learn when I am being shown PowerPoints/Presentations, as I am sitting inactive, and my brain starts to struggle to focus and learn as I am not seeing nor physically doing anything. Visual learning such as interesting videos or being physically taught, keeps me focused, and helps me learn. Along with physical practical work, as I get to perform trial and error, which also keeps me focused.</li>

<br></br>
<li><i>Creativity test:</i> My creativity test shows that I have a “work in progress” form of creativity, the results had surprised me as I honestly thought I had lost my creativity from using it all up as child, but I suppose these results show I still have some creativity left in me, and perhaps it is slowly developing back. I personally feel I am not very creative, as a lot of times I go to organise something with friends whether it be a game or day out, I usually struggle to come up or decide on anything. I feel my creativity is limited to certain areas that I have a strong interest and passion in such as cars as an example. </li>

<br></br>
<li><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b><section>
</section>These results have influenced my behaviour in a team by making me realise and now know of the roles that I can perform well in in terms of teamwork, roles such as being a team leader or team supporter I can fulfil for the team. I have also noticed I can assist the team in communications and resolving any issues, no matter it be a singular team member issue, or a multiple team member issue.
When it comes towards teaching or showing something to the team, I now know the best ways for me to either demonstrate something to the team or be taught something from the team is via visual and practical/physical methods, such as physically showing someone how to resolve an issue with their code or being assisted with an error with my code as examples.
</li>

<br></br>
<li><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b><section>
</section>When forming a team, I should consider the roles mentioned prior, along with the impacts it’ll have on the team. I can benefit team members that struggle with socialising, and team leading by taking on those roles for them or assisting them with it by being a middleman in communications. Also, there may be team members that prefer to work alone or in a different style towards my preferences, I must take that into consideration and ensure I respect and assist their desired work styles to the best of my ability, without distributing them, the team, and the overall work progress/operations.
